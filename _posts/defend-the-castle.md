**🏰 Defend the Castle**
Comming to the Steam store soon.


How long can you survive - when each day only makes the enemy stronger?


Defend the Castle is an intense day-by-day tower defense game where you fight off waves of attackers in a world that never gives you a moment to breathe. Each day brings 5 waves of enemy assaults, and you have only 60 seconds to survive - again and again.


But this isn't just a game about defense. It's a game about choices. What do you upgrade? What do you sacrifice? What will it cost to see one more dawn?


🔥 Features


• Roguelike structure: Death is inevitable - and necessary. Fail to meet your daily kill quota, and it's game over.  

• Strategic upgrades: Between days, spend your hard-earned resources to improve your base, repair the damage, and prepare for what’s next.  

• Hidden threats: Some days feel... different. Something larger stirs in the distance. What awaits at the edge of dawn?  

• Dynamic enemy waves: Each wave features unique combinations of enemy types - no defense holds forever.  

• Atmospheric world: A living battlefield with storm clouds that strike lightning, flocks of birds in the sky, and visual details that breathe life into every deadly sunrise.



⚔️ Fate is Calling
Defend the Castle is as much a battle against time as it is against the enemy. A strategic survival experience where every choice matters - and every day could be your last.
