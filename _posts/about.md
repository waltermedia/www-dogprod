Welcome. 
I'm Linus and I've been making games, painting, and creating music and digital art for most of my adult life.

This site serves as a creative hub for original work in game development, visual art, and music production. Here you'll find my collection of projects, experiments, and ideas reflecting a passion for interactive storytelling, artistic expression, and sound design. If you're using any of my digital or physical content, this site is also a way to reach out whether you need help, advice, or just want to connect. 

While I genuinely appreciate your interest and messages, please note that I'm a father of a young child and run multiple full-time businesses. Response times may vary, but I do my best to reply as soon as I can.

Looking forward to connecting with you!
